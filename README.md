- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeffBP
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics!
- 🌱 I’m currently working through MIT OpenCourseWare 6.034 (Artificial Intelligence) and refreshing on data structures and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I'm not sure yet! I'm a bit of a generalist when it comes to programming, though my favorite language is C++.
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out to my email (jeffpflueger1@gmail.com).
